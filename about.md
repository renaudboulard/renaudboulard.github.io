Software engineer since 8+ years, I currently work at [Getaround](https://fr.getaround.com/) in the Product & Engineering team where I contribute to building a car-sharing service to change the way we use cars. I love building good products and being a team player. 

I worked in various business area such as weather forecast, cartography, bank, events management, medical or mobility. I enjoy sharing knowledge with my team and I had the opportunity to be a speaker at some local events and conferences in order to share more widely. I have focused more on mobile in recent years, but I am curious to work and learn on everything related to software and product developement.
