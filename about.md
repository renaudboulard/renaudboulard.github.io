### About me

Software engineer since 8+ years, currently working at [Getaround](https://uk.getaround.com/) in the Product & Engineering team and contributing to build a car-sharing service to change the way we use cars. I love building great products and being a team player. 

I have worked in various business areas such as weather forecast, cartography, bank, payment, events management, medical or mobility, and in differents configuration for large companie, startups, and also as a freelance. I enjoy sharing knowledge with my team and I had the opportunity to be a speaker at some conferences and local meetup.

In recent years, I have focused my work on mobile product development, but I am curious to work and learn on everything related to software development, product development, team productivity, and management.
