I"Â-<p>How can you improve the quality of your Pull Request description to better describe and explain your work to the person who is going to review your PR and what are the benefits? 
<!--more--></p>

<p>A Pull Request is mainly composed of a <strong>title</strong>, a <strong>description</strong>, some <strong>labels</strong>, and a few <strong>commits</strong> that contain <strong>code</strong>. We should pay attention to each of these component when creating a PR.</p>

<p>A PR without description itâ€™s like throwing away a sheet of paper to your colleague without telling him a word on why you write this paper and what is the purpose of your work. He will have to figure out by himself without a clue. 
It will be time consuming for him time and it will require him extra effort that should have been done by you.</p>

<p><img src="images/pr_papers.gif" alt="gif" /></p>

<p>Is it the image of you that you want to give to your colleagues? I suppose not.</p>

<p>In this article, we will focus on how and what are be the benefit to improve the quality of your title, description, and labels, but we will not see how to improve your commit and pull request code/size, which is also quite important for good PR.</p>

<h2 id="1meaningful-title">1.Meaningful title</h2>
<p>The PR title must be explicit, some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add one-click booking in the booking flow</li>
  <li>Refactor of user sign-up with Google</li>
  <li>Fix error 500 on the payment page</li>
</ul>

<p>If you canâ€™t have a simple title, itâ€™s probably because your PR is too large and you should split your work into smaller PRs. Avoid the word and in the title, because it means you have two distinct part in your PR that can be split into two different PR.</p>

<h2 id="2explain-why">2.Explain why</h2>

<p><strong>Why</strong> did you do this pull request?</p>

<p>Each pull request has an original reason.
Link your PR to the original issue, and write a small summary to help the reviewer to quickly understand the reason of the PR and avoid him the need to read a full feature description or bug description. Make it short 2~3 lines, and it should add an extra value compare to the title, if you think the title is enough to understand the why of the PR you can skip the summary.</p>

<p>If you have no issue to link, add the extra necessary information to understand the <code class="highlighter-rouge">why</code> of your PR.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With github you can use several <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue">keywords such as Resolves</a> or the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Linked issues</code> feature on the right collum of your PR. It will automatically close the issue when the PR will be merge.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="3explain-how">3.Explain how</h2>

<p><strong>How</strong> did you resolve the bug? / how did you implemente the feature? / how did you do the refactoring?</p>

<p>Your commit message and the code itself can explain a lot on how you tackle the issue, but some point like the architectural decision, external lib choice, the reason you implemented an API in a specific way, and a lot of other points canâ€™t be explained only with code.</p>

<p>You have to describe your work to your reviewer to give him the full context and help him to better understand your choices. You can make simple bullets points with the noticeable information, or a more detailed explanation. You can also point to some part of the code in your description to guide your reviewer through the changes.</p>

<p>Be careful, avoid repeating what the code does, well-written and named code should explain itself, but instead explain why you wrote the code the way you did it.</p>

<h2 id="4make-it-visual">4.Make it visual</h2>

<p>If your PR includes a visual update in your application or website you can add a before / after screenshot, to help the reviewer understand the update, using a simple array:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>|     Before     |      After     |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| old_screenshot | new_screenshot |
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also add schemas to explain the new or updated architectural element of your codebase or DB. Or if your PR includes a new animation you can add a gif/video of this animation.</p>

<p>Having a visual element will instantly make it super clear to your reviewer what are the result of your PR.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As the adage say <code class="highlighter-rouge">A picture is worth a thousand words</code> it applies to PR too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="5-use-a-template">5. Use a template</h2>
<p>With <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository">github</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html">gitlab</a>, or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blog/save-time-with-default-pull-request-descriptions?_ga=2.3591863.664000138.1590590343-427180527.1590590343">bitbucket</a> you can add PR templates, to have the same template every time you create a new PR.</p>

<p>I see several benefits of using a template :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid rethinking the way you should describe your PR</li>
  <li>It gives you an incentive to describe your PR when you create it</li>
  <li>Having a common way to describe your pull request across your team. It will help you and your coworkers, know what to expect as a description when you start reviewing a PR.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of PR templates on popular open source repository:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Documentation.md">Gitlab (.gitlab/merge_request_templates/Documentation.md)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md">Kubernetes (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md">React Native (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Start simple, no need to have a huge template that will never be filled by anyone, in my team, we started with a template containing 2 titles <code class="highlighter-rouge">Why</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">How</code> no more. Find a template that works for your need and your team.</p>

<h2 id="6use-labels">6.Use labels</h2>

<p>A label is a meta-data that add extra information to your PR, it must help your reviewer to better understand your PR.</p>

<p>Labels can be used in various ways, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To define the type of PR (New feature, Bug fix, Refactoring, Docs, Bump version, etc..)</li>
  <li>To define the product scope of the PR (Payment, Booking, Admin, User assistance, etcâ€¦)</li>
  <li>To define the stack scope (Front-End, Back-end, Mobile, API, etcâ€¦)</li>
  <li>To define the status of the PR (WIP, Donâ€™t merge, Ready for Prod, ectâ€¦)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are lots of other ways to use labels, I will not recommend a specific way to use them, but when you add a label ask yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What are the benefits for my reviewer to have this information? Will it help him understand the PR faster and better?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some examples :</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Info</th>
      <th>Benefit</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Type of PR (New feature, Bug fix, Bump version, etc..)</td>
      <td>Estimate the type of effort and time required for the review</td>
      <td>Reviewing a Bump version will probably require less time and effort than reviewing a new feature and not the same type of focus</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Product scope (Payment, Booking, etc..)</td>
      <td>Helps to project himself into a part of the product and therefore of the codebase</td>
      <td>If your reviewer has a good knowledge of the code base, seeing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Payment</code> label will instantly make it think about your payment systems/services, and we will expect your PR to update this part of the code</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stack scope (Front-End, Back-end, API, etc..)</td>
      <td>Help to project himself into a part of the code base, and a type of coding</td>
      <td>With a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Front-end</code> label, the reviewer will instantly think about a visual update and project himself in the view/template/js part of your code (whatever your stack is)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PR status (WIP, Review Needed, etc..)</td>
      <td>Estimate the amount of effort and time required for the review</td>
      <td>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">WIP</code> PR will require more a macro review no need to ding in all small details, and it will probably require less time to be reviewed</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a good title and label, the reviewer can already learn a lot on your PR from the PR list without even the need to reading the description or the code of your PR. He will be able to project himself on some part of the product and the codebase. This will also help him to prioritize PR more easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="benefit-of-a-good-pr-description">Benefit of a good PR description</h2>

<p>Improving the way you describe your pull request has several benefits:</p>

<p><strong>For you</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Taking the time to think about how to describe your work will give you the chance to see your PR from another point of view and it could lead to improvements before you send the PR.</li>
  <li>If you canâ€™t simply describe the work done, it probably means there is a way of improving it or rethinks/split your PR</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For the reviewer</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The more time you take to write a good PR description, the more time will be saved by your reviewer to understand the context, and the work done on your PR.</li>
  <li>A good description will help your reviewer to quickly switch context from is current work with less effort.</li>
  <li>He will most likely enjoy reviewing your PRs if there are more attractive, which will surely lead to better and faster code review.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For the other team members</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>New developer joining your team will be able to learn a lot from what has been done in the past and the reason of some choice, just by looking at previous PR.</li>
  <li>Junior dev or another team member that arenâ€™t the PR reviewer, but who are curious of whatâ€™s going on in the code base, will be able to quickly read a PR description and more easily understand the update, without the need to read complex part of the code where they havenâ€™t work on yet. Itâ€™s a good way to widen their knowledge and onboard on a new part of the product.</li>
</ul>

<p>A good PR description is a win-win for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="pr-description-is-underrated">PR description is underrated</h2>

<p>The value of a good PR description is underrated, we tend to think that good code and well-named commit is enough. And yes itâ€™s important, it should be the priority in your PR because, in the end, you will only keep the commits and the code in your codebase, not the PR description.</p>

<p>But a good PR description and a good title and labels will make your PR much more attractive and clear for your reviewer. It will improve the communication between you and the other developers of your team. In the long term, Iâ€™m convinced it boosts the review process and the productivity of your team and company.</p>
